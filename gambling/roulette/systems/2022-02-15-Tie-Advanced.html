    A.K.A "Advanced Tie Fighter"

<p>
    6 Friends all got "whacked"! There are only 6 open numbers, so that's a pretty bad run.
</p>
<p>
    We're not betting on 36 numbers and there are no bets that can be consolidated, so I can't
    make any improvements to this.
</p>
<p>
    The bets are simple and easy to reach, so I'll give this sytem a A. Just try to find a
    Single-Zero Roulette wheel if you can.
