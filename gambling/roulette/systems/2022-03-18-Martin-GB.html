<p>
    I'm not going to create the Roulette Bet Analyzer images for this system. It's just too
    stupid and needlessly complicated. But you're supposed to take down winning bets and 
    double-up losing bets until they hit. Calculating the payouts shouldn't be that difficult.

    I simply can't get over the stupidity of betting both sides of the Even Money bets and all
    three columns and all three dozens. Just asinine.
