title: About Jack Hayes
---

<p>
    JackAce.com is an educational site teaching the donkeys of the world about gambling, cryptocurrencies, and 
    mathematics.
</p>
<p>
    Most topics will be at an introductory level, so you don't need to be a Mathematician to follow along. Most
    of our posts and videos will be an intersection of two or more of the topics in the Venn Diagram below.

<h3>Gambling</h3>
<p>
    Sometimes the "gambling" includes gaming, games, puzzles, and gaming culture.
</p>
<h3>Cryptocurrencies</h3>
<p>
    I don't plan on discussing things like investment tips at all. Discussions about crypto will generally be
    around the mathematics of crypto as well as security and news. I am currently running several Ethereum 2.0
    validators, and I plan on discussing tips on managing them.
</p>
<h3>Mathematics</h3>
<p>
    The "math" part of the site will also include software engineering and some discussions on technology.
