<p>
    If you're the type of person who likes to spread their bets around the Roulette table, you should know 
    about <i>the Distributive Property of Roulette Betting</i>. It can save you a lot of time, hassle, and
    awkwardness if your bets can be consolidated into larger multi-number bets.
</p>

<h2>What is the Distributive Property of Roulette Betting?</h2>
<p>
    The Distributive Property of Roulette Betting states
</p>
<blockquote>
    Every multi-number bet (besides the 5-number bet) can be reconstructed by distributing the bet
    amount equally amongst the numbers covered by the original bet.
</blockquote>
<p>
    or in other words
</p>
<blockquote>
    Betting $X on an n-number bet is equivalent to betting \($X \over n\) each of the n numbers Straight-up.
</blockquote>
<p>
    which can be represented formulaically as
</p>
<p class="p-center">
    \({$X \times Payout_n} \equiv n \times {$X \over n} \times Payout_1 \)
</p>
<p>
    Where \(\color{#8acdd8}Payout_n\) is the payout multiplier for an n-number bet (when \(n \neq 5\)).
</p>
<p>
    And this is true for all variations of Roulette, including single-zero, double-zero, and even the
    <b>horrendous</b> triple-zero wheel.
</p>
<p>
    So betting $6 on the 6-number "Double Street" is equivalent to making six $1 bets on each of the
    covered numbers individually.
</p>

    <figcaption>
        These two betting configurations are equivalent.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Does this really work?</h3>
<p>
    If we look at the two sets of wagers above, we can easily see that hitting any number outside of
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="1 Red" /> -
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/6_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="6 Black" />
    will
    result in a <span class="amt-neg">$6</span> loss. But what happens when we hit a number between
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="1 Red" /> and
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/6_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="6 Black" />?
</p>
<p>
    With the single $6 Double Street bet, we win 5-to-1, for a net win of
    <span class="amt-pos">$30</span>.
</p>
<p>
    With the six $1 Straight-up bets, we will lose five of the $1 bets, but one will win $35,
    for a net win of <span class="amt-pos">$30</span>.
</p>
<p>
    So in <i>both</i> scenarios, we lose <span class="amt-neg">$6</span> when we miss and win
    <span class="amt-pos">$30</span> when we hit.
</p>
<p>
    This property works with any combination of bets where the bets are all uniform.
    You can consolidate three Straight-up bets into a 3-number Street bet. You can
    consolidate four Straight-up bets into one 4-number Corner bet. You can even consolidate
    two Street bets into a single Double Street bet.

    <figcaption>
        These are all equivalent decompositions of the $6 Double Street bet.

    The only bet where this property does not apply is the 5-number "Basket" bet, which is a bet on
    the numbers

</p>

<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>
    If you've never heard of the <i>Distributive Property of Roulette Betting</i>, it's probably because I
    literally just made it up. Recently, I've been analyzing Roulette betting systems and noticed how
    a lot of them waste time by making you sprinkle bets needlessly all over the layout. I've never seen
    this property formally discussed anywhere, so I thought I'd just give it a formal name.
</p>
<p>
    I named it the Distributive Property because you're just taking the multi-number bet and distributing
    it equally across the single-number bets.
</p>
<p>
    Hopefuly, you've already read my post on the 
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2021/12/29/The-Basics-of-Roulette-Math/">Basics of Roulette Math</a>.
    In that post, I cover the names
    of all the multi-number bets, so if you're not familiar with them, please read that post first.
</p>
<p>
    Before I explain how this all works, let's go over some of the other terms
    involved in this property.
</p>

<h3>Distribution/Decomposition</h3>
<p>
    <i>Distribution</i> or <i>Decomposition</i> is taking a multi-number bet and breaking it down into smaller bets,
    often a series of "Straight-up" single-number bets.
</p>
<p>
    It's also possible to distrubute a multi-number bet into smaller multi-number bets. For example, a $12
    Double Street bet can be split into two $6 Street bets. Or it could be split into a $6 Street
    bet and three $2 Straight-up bets. Or it could be split into an $8 Corner bet and a $4 Split bet.
</p>

    <figcaption>
        You can break down a multi-number bet in many different ways.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Consolidation</h3>
<p>
    <i>Consolidation</i> is "rolling-up" individual bets into a single bet with the same win/loss characteristics.
    A typical consolidation is taking n number of $X Straight-up bets into a single $nx n-number bet. For example,
    rolling up four $2 bets into a single $8 Corner bet.    
</p>

<h3>Density</h3>
<p>
    <i>Density</i> or <i>Betting Density</i> is the bet amount per spot once a multi-number bet has
    been fully distributed to single-number bets. You can also think of this as the <i>equity</i> per spot.
</p>
<p>
    In order for two betting scenarios to be equivalent, their betting density must be equal for the covered
    area. For example, you can bet $6 on the
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="1 Red" /> -
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/6_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="6 Black" />
    Double Street, but that would have a different density
    compared to betting $3 on the 
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="1 Red" />, 
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/2_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="2 Black" />,
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/4_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="4 Black" />,
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/5_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="5 Red" />
    Corner Bet in conjunction with a $3
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/3_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="3 Red" />, 
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/6_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="6 Black" />
    Split Bet. This implies that the two betting schemes are not equivalent and will pay out
    differently when the numbers hit.
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-01-11/04-drake-600x766.png" alt="Drake knows what's up. Make sure the betting density is consistent, or Distributive Property won't apply." />
    <figcaption>
        For two betting schemes to be equivalent, their densities must be consistent. In this example,
        the $3 + $3 bets are unevenly spread out even though the total amout bet is the same. The
        overall payout will be higher if you hit the 
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="1 Red" /> or
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/4_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="4 Black" />
        (<span class="amt-pos">$48</span>) over hitting the 
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/2_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="2 Black" />,
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/3_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="3 Red" />, 
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/5_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="5 Red" />, or
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/6_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="6 Black" />,
        (<span class="amt-pos">$21</span>).
        With the $2 + $4 bets, the payout is consistently <span class="amt-pos">$30</span>, which is
        identical to the payout for the $6 Double Street bet.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>What is this Sorcery?</h2>
<p>
    This all magically works out because all Roulette bets (besides that pesky 5-number bet) have the same
    horrible house edge (<span class="amt-bad">5.26%</span> for double-zero!). This means if you bet the same
    amount on n spots, your Expected Value (EV) should be <i>exactly the same</i> if you bet that same amount
    on an n-number bet. 
</p>
<p>
    And we can prove this mathematcially using one of the formulas I introduced in my post on the
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2021/12/29/The-Basics-of-Roulette-Math/">Basics of Roulette Math</a>.
    The payout for every bet in Roulette (besides the 5-number bet) can be calculated by using
    the formula:
</p>
<p class="p-center">
    $$ { Payout_n } = { {36 - n} \over n } $$
</p>

<p>
    So an $n wager on an n-number bet can be calculated as
</p>
<p>
    \begin{align}
    n \times { Payout_n } & = { n \times { {36 - n} \over n } } \\
    \\
    & = 36 - n \\
    \\
    & = 36 - 1 - n + 1 \\
    \\
    & = { {36 - 1} \over 1 } - (n - 1) \\
    \\
    & = { Payout_1 } - (n - 1) \\
    \end{align}
</p>
<p>
    Which is the win from a single $1 Straight-up bet minus the <i>(n-1)</i> losses from the losing
    Straight-up bets.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if you bet $1 on 12 numbers Straight-up, then one of those bets will win $35 and 11 of those
    bets will lose, for a net win of $24, which is what your 2-to-1 payout would be for betting $12 on a dozen
    or column.
</p>
<p>
    \begin{align}
    $12 \times { Payout_{12} } & = { Payout_1 } - (12 - 1) \\
    \\
    $12 \times 2 & = $35 - $11 \\
    \\
    $24 & = $24 \\
    \end{align}
</p>
<p>
    Here's the formula applied to all 7 bet types (without the 5-number bet):

<h2>How can I make use of the Distributive Property of Roulette Betting?</h2>
<p>
    I've been watching a lot of Roulette system reviews on
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CEGDealerSchool">CEG Dealer School's YouTube Channel</a>, and I've
    noticed that the systems submittied by viewers are often impractical when it comes to betting at a
    brick and mortar casino.
</p>
<p>
    These systems may seem enjoyable on paper or even tapping your finger on a Roulette iPad app, but it's
    often extremely impractical to bet on spots all over a real-world table, since you may have to
    reach over other people.
</p>
<p>
    If you can consolidate your bets using the Distributive Property of Roulette
    Betting, you can often save time and prevent yourself from awkwardly reaching over
    other people. On a Roulette table, reach-arounds are a bad thing.
</p>
<h3>Case Study: "Diamond Heist"</h3>

    <figcaption>
        In CEG Dealer School's review of the system named
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZgHu0fdWTo&t=80s">"Diamond Heist"</a>, they bet $30
        across 6 Corner bets that are spread evenly across the first two columns. They could have just
        put $15 on Column 1 and $15 on Column 2, saving time and the dreaded "reach around" -
        stretching their arms awkwardly across the felt and annoying other players.

<p>
    A few days ago, The CEG Dealer School reviewed a Roulette system named
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZgHu0fdWTo&t=80s" target="_blank">"Diamond Heist"</a>,
    where they made 6 Corner bets that covered the entire first two columns. For the purposes of this
    post, we're going to ignore the other bets involved in this system.
</p>
<figure>

    <figcaption>
        The 6 bets in question in the "Diamond Heist" Roulette system.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    There is $30 covering the first two columns evenly. This is the perfect candidate for consolidation!
    Instead of these 6 bets, we can place $15 on each of the first two columns.
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-01-11/07-ceg-dh-800x387.png" alt="These two $15 bets are easier to make." />
    <figcaption>
        It's easier to make two $15 on one side of the felt rather than spread $30 all across the table,
        especially when the table is full.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    Hitting one of the Corner bets in the original system pays $40, but you lose $25 in the other Corner
    bets, for a net gain of <span class="amt-pos">$15</span>.
</p>
<p>
    Hitting one of the Column bets in the modified system pays $30, but you lose $15 on the other column
    bet, for a net gain of <span class="amt-pos">$15</span>.
</p>
<p>
    With the two column bets, you've concentrated your bets to one small section of the field, instead of
    stretching across 2/3 of the inside betting area.

    The CEG Dealer School crew also reviewed another system called
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQNx0Cczlvw" target="_blank">"Not too Low, Not too High"</a>,
    which has even <i>more</i> opportunities to consolidate.

    <figcaption>
        This is the original version of the "Not too Low, Not too High" system, with three sets of
        three $10 Splits that can be consolidated into three $30 Double Street bets.

<p>
    In this system, all the Split bets can be rolled up into three $30 Double Street bets.

    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/21_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="21 Red" />
    Double Street bet can then be redistributed into
    two $15 Street bets. Then the four Street Bets in the middle ($10, $15, $15, and $10) can be
    consolidated by taking $10 of each bet and rolling it up into a single $40 bet on the 2nd Dozen,
    leaving two $5 Street Bets in the middle two Streets. These are finally rolled up into a $10

    your negative expected loss to the house.
