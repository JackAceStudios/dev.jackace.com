<p>
    It is often said that the worst thing you can do in Roulette is play the 5-number Top Line bet, but this is
    absolutely false. There's something you can do that's even worse. You can make combinations of bets that
    render all your bets <b>WORTHLESS</b>.
</p>

<h2>What is "Bet Nullification"?</h2>
<p>
    Some people <i>really</i> like to spread their bets around the Roulette table. They don't just make one or two
    bets covering a small section of the table, they go hog wild, taking up tons of real estate on the felt.
    They're hedging their bets to increase their chances of getting paid, even though it results in a smaller
    overall payout.
</p>
<p>
    But if you end up spreading yourself <i>too</i> thin, you can put yourself in a situation where it becomes 
    <b>IMPOSSIBLE</b> to win. This is easy to see if you bet both sides of an even money bet.
</p>
<p>
    For example, you could bet $100 on
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/x18_red.svg" alt="Red" class="roulette-spot"/>
    AND $100 on
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/x18_black.svg" alt="Black" class="roulette-spot"/>
    and 94.7% of the time you'll end
    up with no gain and no loss. In this case, when the Roulette ball lands on any number between
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" alt="1 Red" class="roulette-spot"/>
    and <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/36_r.svg" alt="36 Red" class="roulette-spot"/>, your $100 winning bet
    will cancel out your $100 losing bet.
</p>
<p>
    But when you hit the
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/0_g.svg" alt="0 Green" class="roulette-spot"/>
    or the <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/00_g.svg" alt="00 Green" class="roulette-spot"/>, you'll
    lose <b>ALL $200</b>!
</p>
<p>

        <figcaption>If you cover 36 numbers you might not have <b>ANY</b> way to win.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</p>
<p>
    This is a result of <i>Bet Nullification</i>.
</p>
<p>
    If you've never heard this term before, it's because I made it up. I named it this because you're making bets
    that render your other bets useless or "nullified". Whenever the win from one bet completely cancels
    out the losses of another bet (or set of bets), there is zero upside to making the bets at all.
</p> 
<p>
    And creating a Bet Nullification situation is a mathematical <i>certainty</i> once you hit the threshold of
    betting on 36 different numbers.
</p> 

<h2>How can we Eliminate Bet Nullification?</h2>
<p>
    The
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/x18_red.svg" alt="Red" class="roulette-spot"/>/<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/x18_black.svg" alt="Black" class="roulette-spot"/>
    bet example is an <i>EXTREMELY</i> simple example of how you could make bets that nullify each
    other, but there are often inside and outside bet combinations that are more difficult to identify.
</p> 
<p>
    To figure out how to elimininate the redundant bets, we first want to distribute all multi-number bets into
    Straight-up bets using the 
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2022/01/11/Distributative-Bets-in-Roulette/">Distributive Property of Roulette Betting</a>.
</p>
<p>
    This is trivial using the 
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/gambling/roulette/bet-analyzer/">Roulette Bet Analyzer</a> I've created. Just enter the
    bets into the betting layout and look at the numbers in the <i>Equity per Spot</i> section.
</p>
<p>
    After distributing all your multi-number bets into Straight-up bets, you should do the following:
</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>
            If you bet on
        </th>
        <th>
            then you should
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="cell-center">
            36<br/>Numbers
        </td>
        <td>
            Identify the lowest amount of equity per spot and subtract it from every Straight-up bet.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="cell-center">
            37<br/>Numbers
        </td>
        <td>
            &bull; Ignore the lowest bet amount.<br/>
            &bull; Identify the lowest amount of the remaining 36 bets and subtract that from the highest 36
            Straight-up bets.<br/>
            &bull; After subtracting that amount, repeat this process if you still have equity on 36 numbers.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="cell-center">
            38<br/>Numbers
        </td>
        <td>
            &bull; Ignore the two lowest bet amounts.<br/>
            &bull; Identify the lowest amount of the remaining 36 bets and subtract that from the highest 36
            Straight-up bets.<br/>
            &bull; After subtracting that amount, repeat this process if you still have equity on 36 or more
            numbers.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="cell-center">
            39<br/>Numbers
        </td>
        <td>
            Ask yourself, <b>"Why the Hell am I playing Triple-Zero Roulette?"</b> and shut off
            your computer.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Analying the "Diamond Heist" Roulette System</h2>
<p>
    I was watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZgHu0fdWTo" target="_blank">CEG Dealer School's</a>
    YouTube channel recently and they were playing a system called "DIAMOND HEIST!" where they made the
    following bets:
</p> 
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-01-22/02-original-system-800x387.png" alt="Roulette Bets" />
    <figcaption>
        "ðŸ’Ž HEIST!" Roulette System <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZgHu0fdWTo" target="_blank">tested
        and reviewed by CEG Dealer School</a>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    It may not be instantly apparent, but they managed to spread $95 across all 36 Non-zero numbers.
</p> 
<p>
    And it's tough to see exactly <i>how much</i> of the $95 is being wasted, but it is <b>A LOT</b>. In fact,
    $45 of the $95 is cancelling itself out (47.3%!).
</p> 
<p>
    Entering these bets into the
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/gambling/roulette/bet-analyzer/">Roulette Bet Analyzer</a>,
    we can take a look at how our bets are distributed:
</p> 
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-01-22/04-og-equity-800x198.png" alt="There is $1.25 or more on every number" />
    <figcaption>
        Here we can see we've bet at least $1.25 on every number
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    And let's look at the payouts:
</p> 
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-01-22/05-og-win-loss-800x198.png" alt="The Win/Loss results for every number" />
    <figcaption>
        These are the win/loss results for every number. Pay close attention to the
        <span class="amt-neg">$95</span> loss on
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/0_g.svg" alt="0 Green" class="roulette-spot"/>
        and <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/00_g.svg" alt="00 Green" class="roulette-spot"/>.        
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    Once we spread the bets out like this, it's easy to see that we're betting $1.25 or more on <i>EVERY NUMBER</i>!
    This means that we can remove $1.25 per spot without impacting any of the payouts.
    Multiplying $1.25 by 36, we can see we're wasting $45 of the $95 being bet!
</p>
<p>
    So if we subtract $1.25 from every spot, our total amount bet will 
    be $50 and our bets will look like this:
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-01-22/06-improved-equity-800x198.png" alt="Roulette Bets (Improved system)" />
    <figcaption>
        Here we've subtracted $1.25 from every spot in the original system because the bets were "nullifying" each other.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    And what do the payouts look like in our modified system?
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-01-22/07-improved-win-loss-800x198.png" alt="Roulette Bets (Improved system)" />
    <figcaption>
        Every payout is exactly the same in the 
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" alt="1 Red" class="roulette-spot"/>
        to <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/36_r.svg" alt="36 Red" class="roulette-spot"/>
        section of the layout, but you lose $45 less when you hit
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/0_g.svg" alt="0 Green" class="roulette-spot"/>
        and <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/00_g.svg" alt="00 Green" class="roulette-spot"/>.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    So with this betting scheme, <i>EVERY SINGLE PAYOUT IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL SYSTEM</i> - with the
    exception of the losses on <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/0_g.svg" alt="0 Green" class="roulette-spot"/>
    and <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/00_g.svg" alt="00 Green" class="roulette-spot"/>. When the
    zeroes hit, you only lose <span class="amt-neg">$50</span> instead of the original
    <span class="amt-neg">$95</span>.
</p>
<p>
    So, your expected loss per spin in the improved system is only \(-5.26\% \times $50\) or
    <span class="amt-neg">-$2.63</span>, instead of \(-5.26\% \times $95\) or
    <span class="amt-neg">-$5.00</span> with the original system.
</p>
<p>
    If you look at these bets and you're thinking that a casino won't let you bet these fractional amounts
    (like $2.08 on
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/5_r.svg" alt="5 Red" class="roulette-spot"/>), 
    that's true. But it just so happens that we can rearrage all these bets and come up with the following bets that 
    a casino <i>will</i> allow (this is not always the case when removing nullified bets).
</p>

        The

        allows you to roll up bets without impacting your
        wins or losses.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    And this makes sense if you understand what bets were removed. We've pulled $15 off the 3rd column and we've taken
    down $30 in 6 corner bets that makes up the first two columns. Those 6 bets could have been replicated by putting
    $15 on the 1st column and $15 on the 2nd column. This is possible by applying principles from my post on the
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2022/01/11/Distributative-Bets-in-Roulette/">Distributive Property of Roulette Betting</a>.
    After that, getting rid of the $45 of nullified bets becomes trivial.

    <figcaption>The removed bets are displayed here in yellow. The $25 column bet is broken up into $10 and $15</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>Always Check your Systems!</h2>
<p>
    So if someone tells you that the 5-number bet is the worst play in Roulette, tell them they're wrong.
</p> 
<p>
    Since there is NO chance of coming out ahead with a set of nullified bets, the wagers taken as a whole
    are essentially worthless. You have risked the locked up bets for ZERO reward.
</p> 
<p>
    If you have a system you'd like analyzed or reviewed, make sure that you're not
    betting on more than 35 numbers at a time. You can run it through the
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/gambling/roulette/bet-analyzer/">Roulette Bet Analyzer</a> to be certain.
</p> 
<p>
    If you find yourself betting on 36 different numbers, just recognize that you've triggered a Bet
    Nullification situation. Identify the nullified bets and remove them. You'll save yourself a lot of
    negative Expected Value (EV) with absolutely no downside!
