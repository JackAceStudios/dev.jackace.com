    No, <i>"6-to-5 Blackjack"</i> isn't Blackjack that you play at 4:54pm. It is an atrocity and one of the worst
    things  to happen to Blackjack in the past few <b>decades</b>.
</p>

<h2>What is 6-to-5 Blackjack?</h2>
<p>
    Remember when corporate America took that thing you loved and changed it into some horrible ðŸ’© all in the name 
    greed? Maybe they took your sports team's iconic stadium and rebranded it with their garbage name. Maybe they
    replaced your favorite soda's sugar with high fructose corn syrup. Or maybe they rebooted your favorite
    childhood movie and cast Will Smith as a singing blue genie.

        World Series Championship in 2017.

<p>
    Well, corporate America has done it again. They've ruined blackjack.
</p>
<p>
    A few years back, casinos introduced something called <i>"6-to-5 Blackjack"</i> and it's slowly been taking over
    low-limit tables in Las Vegas.
</p>
<p>
    It looks like Blackjack.<br/>
    It <i>feels</i> like Blackjack.<br/>
    It even <i>smells</i> like Blackjack.
</p>
<p>
    But there's a <b>HUGE</b> difference: 6-to-5 Blackjack <i>short-changes your Blackjack bonus by <b>60%</b></i>.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="amt-bad">SIXTY PERCENT!</span>
</p>
<p>
    Let's say you make a $20 bet. When you start your hand with a two-card 21, it's considered a
    {%- include glossary-term.html term="natural" displayName="\"Natural Blackjack\"" -%} (or just a
    "Blackjack"), and you're supposed win $20 <b>plus an extra $10 bonus</b>
    for a total of $30. In 6-to-5 Blackjack, you only win $6 for every $5 you bet for your Blackjack (hence
    <i>"6-to-5"</i>), for a total of $24. Subtract your original bet of $20 and your bonus is only <b>$4</b>!
</p>
<p>
    With 6-to-5 Blackjack, <b>the $10 Blacjack bonus you deserve would be reduced to just $4</b>!

<h2>The House Edge of 6-to-5</h2>
<p>
    You can calculate the cost of playing 6-to-5 Blackjack pretty easily. To start, you need to know how frequently
    you can expect a starting hand of 21 and I <i>promise</i> it's easy to remember (You'll be quizzed on this
    later).
</p>
<blockquote>
    On average, you will receive a Blackjack every <b>21 hands</b>.
</blockquote>
<p>
    So estimating the cost of this rule variant becomes pretty easy. Multiply the probability of having a
    Blackjack (\(1 \over 21\)) by the probability of the dealer <i>not</i> having a Blackjack
    (\(1 - {1 \over 21}\) or \(20 \over 21\)) and the change in your payout, which is 60% of your regular
    half-bet bonus (0.50 of your bet), and you get:
</p>
<p>
    \begin{align}
    {1 \over 21} \times {20 \over 21} \times -0.60 \times 0.50 & \approx -0.0136054 \\
    & \approx \color{red}{-1.36054\%}
    \end{align}
</p>
<p>
    Which is a great approximation for the actual cost of this rule variant! When you look at the actual
    cost of the rule, it comes <i>very</i> close:

<p>
    The actual change in house advantage depends on the number of decks in play, because with fewer
    decks, the frequency of receiving blackjacks goes up. This is because receiving an Ace as your
    first card increases your chances of receiving a Ten as your second card (and vice versa) when
    you have fewer decks. The more decks you use, the lower this effect.
</p>

<h2>6-to-5 versus other Table Conditions</h2>
<p>
    How does this rule change compare to other table conditions?
</p>
<p>
    The 6-to-5 rule variant has <i>by far</i> the biggest affect on the casino's house advantage amongst
    all rule variants.
</p>
<h3>Increasing the Number of Decks</h3>
<p>
    How bad is it? Well, after the 6-to-5 payout change, the next biggest change would be moving from
    single deck Blackjack to 8 deck Blackjack. Increasing the number of decks from 1 to 8 increases the
    house edge by 0.48%. That makes the 6-to-5 change almost <i>3 times worse</i>!
</p>
<h3>Hitting Soft 17s</h3>
<p>
    Besides changing the number of decks in play, casinos can add to their edge by hitting a Soft 17
    instead of standing. This change will only cost the player 0.2125% in house advantage, making
    the 6-to-5 rule more than <b>6 TIMES WORSE</b>!
</p>

<h3>The Rest is even Smaller Potatoes</h3>
<p>
    And as we go through other possible rule variants, everything else just gets dwarfed by 6-to-5.
</p>

        Before the introduction of the 6-to-5 variant, the house edge of Blackjack was very low for even some

<h2>We could all use a little Chaaaaaaaange!</h2>
<p>
    One negative aspect of 6-to-5 Blackjack that I almost <i>never</i> hear discussed is that you end
    up with <i>a lot</i> of odd chips that you wouldn't normally have in front of you.
</p>
<p>
    For pretty much <i>ALL</i> betting units, getting paid 6-to-5 on a Blackjack will
    leave you with chips you wouldn't normally have to deal with.

    It's true that some bet sizes will also get mismatched chips with standard 3-to-2 Blackjack, but this
    only with specific betting units ($25 bet getting paid $37.50 on a Blackjack is a prime example), and
    this inconvenience is greatly mitigated because it only takes one <i>extra</i> blackjack to make that
    half-bet whole.
</p>
<p>
    After receiving that second blackjack in 3-to-2, you can use those two half-bets to make a full bet on
    the next hand. So on average in standard Blackjack, you will only be sitting with those odd chips for
    21 hands (<b>Pop-Quiz:</b> Do you remember why?).
</p>
<p>
    But after receiving your first Blackjack in 6-to-5, you'll be sitting there with only 20% of your unit
    bet in odd chips, and you would expect to sit there for much longer before you can reconstruct a
    full-sized bet.
</p>
<p>
    On average, you would expect to wait for another <b>4 Blackjacks</b> or <b>84 HANDS</b> (4 x one
    Blackjack every 21 hands), and the entire time you're waiting, your stack of odd chips will just
    continue to get awkwardly larger.

    <figcaption>
        Not only are odd chip denominations annoying, but they often make their way to the dealer's tip box
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Why Does Having Odd Chips Matter?</h3>
<p>
    I'm not bringing this up because I'm some neat freak who obsesses about keeping his chip stacks the same
    color. I'm bringing this up because you will occasionally get pressured into tipping away those odd
    chips.
</p>
<p>
    Even though I've found <i>most</i> dealers to be quite professional and courteous while playing Blackjack,
    I've run into a fair number of dealers who are more than vocal and sometimes downright <i>rude</i>
    when you win a few hands and haven't made a bet for them.
</p>
<p>
    So in addition to getting short-changed on your payouts, now you've got a crabby dealer mad-dogging
    you as your odd-chip Blackjack scoreboard grows larger and larger.
</p>
<p>
    I'm very much in favor of tipping dealers who are pleasant and who deal you good hands. These dealers
    depend on tips to make a living, and they should be rewarded for doing their job well. But if you're
    tipping away your Blackjack bonus, there's almost no chance that you're going to walk away a
    winner in 6-to-5.
</p>

<h2>Why do People Play 6-to-5 Blackjack?</h2>
<p>
    Because most people are <i>Donkeys</i>. I say <i>most</i> because you're reading this post, so at
    least you're trying to be a smarter about it!
</p>
<p>
    There are four main reasons why people play this horrible game:
</p>
<h3>It's often paired with Single Deck</h3>
<p>
    The 6-to-5 payout is often combined with single deck Blackjack, a table condition that is characterized
    as being <i>"player friendly"</i>.
</p>
<p>
    While this is generally true, when paired with 6-to-5, the single deck game becomes the carrot casinos
    offer before beating you with their stick.
</p>
<p>
    And it's worse than you might initially think.
</p>
<p>
    As we have already discussed, the 6-to-5 payout penalty dwarfs the benefit of switching from 6 deck to
    single deck. Your initial estimate for the overall affect would be to just add the benefit from single
    deck blackjack (<span class="amt-pos">+0.457%</span>) and subtract the penalty for 6-to-5 
    (<span class="amt-neg">-1.365%</span>), but the overall benefit to the house is even worse.
</p>
<p>
    This is because most of the benefit from lowering the number of decks is from the increase in blackjack
    frequency. With the lower 6-to-5 payout, the benefits of single deck are Nerfed.
</p>
<p>
    \begin{align}
    EV_{1deck} + EV_{6 to 5} & < EV_{1deck + 6 to 5} \\
    0.45742 + -1.36504 & < -0.93736 \\
    -0.90762 & < \color{red}{-0.93736} \\
    \end{align}
</p>
<p>
    As you can see, the <i>actual</i> change in negative
    <span class="tooltip">Expected Value (EV)
        <span class="tooltiptext">Expected Value - the amount you would be expected to lose.</span>
    </span> 
    is <i>greater than</i> the sum of
    the two conditions applied independently.
</p>
<h3>It's Your Only Choice at Lower Limit Tables</h3>
<p>
    I've heard people say that 6-to-5 is good because it offers a way for casinos to offer Blackjack to players 
    who can't afford the higher limit <i>Real</i> Blackjack tables.
</p>
<p>
    I strongly disagree. You wouldn't try to make flying more affordable by removing your plane's stabilization
    system. Sure, more people could afford flying, but the experience would be completely uncomfortable
    and people flying for the first time would likely <i>never</i> fly again.
</p>
<p>
    Novice players already make tons of mistakes. Combine that with the 6-to-5 tax, and these players will be
    even <i>more</i> likely to lose. These losing players are unlikely to graduate to higher stakes.

    titled <i>"Blackjack's Rise And Fall Shows What Drives Customers Away"</i> that seems to agree:
</p>
<blockquote>
    The biggest offender, though, was 6:5 blackjack. This variation, which is regrettably common in Las Vegas
    casinos, cuts the payout on blackjacks from 3:2 to 6:5; that $150 win we celebrated in the third paragraph
    is now only $120.
</blockquote>
<p>
    New players will be destined to lose and the gap in revenue between people who grew up with 3-to-2 and new
    players only familiar with 6-to-5 will continue to widen, driving revenue down even further.
</p>

<h3>People Don't Understand Fractions</h3>
<p>
    Some people see the "6" and the "5" and just associate it with a higher payout than the normal 3-to-2 payout.
    You'd think that people would have better math skills than that, but remember when the A&amp;W Restaurant chain
    tried selling a 1/3 pound burger and
    <a href="https://www.adweek.com/agencies/aws-1-3rd-pound-burger-failed-so-its-trying-a-3-9th-pound-burger-instead/" target="_blank">it failed because people thought it was smaller than McDonald's Quarter Pounder</a>?
</p>
<blockquote>
    "Well of course the Quarter Pounder's bigger! The Quarter Pounder's got a 4 in it and the Third Pounder's only got a measley 3!"
    <footer>
        - those people, probably
    </footer>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Well A&amp;W's marketing department seems to have learned from their mistakes and they've
    reintroduced the burger as a <i>3/9th Pounder</i>!

<p>
    As silly as this might seem, not understanding fractions affects a fair amount of the population and is
    probably a significant reason why 6-to-5 is tolerated.
</p>

<h3>Ain't Nobody Got Time Fo' Dat</h3>
<p>
    Possibly the biggest reason why people end up playing at these tables is a combination of both ignorance and
    indifference. Unfortunately, gambling is becoming less and less of an attraction for tourists. Casinos now
    need to provide ultra-fine dining, and A-List DJs and performers in their night clubs and theaters.
</p>

        A-List resident artists are high in demand and cost a pretty penny...
        <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/entertainment/adele-las-vegas-residency-cancel/index.html" target="_blank">when they actually show up</a>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    For these new-school Vegas tourists, gambling is just background noise. They don't know much about 
    any of the games casinos offer. They've never even seen a
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blackjack-Basic-Strategy-Chart-Dealer/dp/0982119151/" target="_blank">Blackjack Basic Strategy card</a>.
    For the new generation of Las Vegas tourists, even taking a second to calculate whether 6-to-5
    pays more standard Blackjack isn't worth the mental effort. They know they're going to play anyway.
</p>
<p>
    So after a night of partying with
    <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/entertainment-columns/kats/tiesto-leads-zouks-2022-spin-cycle-at-resorts-world-2520398/" target="_blank">TiÃ«sto at the club</a>
    or after eating at
    <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/food/joel-robuchon-restaurants-at-mgm-grand-set-for-reopening-2380365/" target="_blank">Michelin Star Rated Joel Robuchon</a>,
    these people will sit down at whatever Blackjack table the casino has and tolerate whatever shitty rules
    they offer.
</p>

<h2>Stand up to Corporate Greed!</h2>
<p>
    6-to-5 Blackjack isn't real Blackjack. My hope is that by educating the Donkeys of the world we can
    eventually turn the tide on this rule variant as well as the deluge of similar changes
    soon to follow.
</p>
<p>
    In the grand scheme of things, 6-to-5 Blackjack is far from the worst game that casinos offer.
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2021/12/29/The-Basics-of-Roulette-Math/">Double-Zero Roulette is much worse</a>
    with its house edge of 5.26%. Single deck 6-to-5 only has a house edge of about 1.7%.
</p>
<p>
    So why does 6-to-5 Blackjack piss me off so much? Because Blackjack used to be a game that people
    could play at <i>any</i> betting level and be almost even with the house <i>if they took the time
    to study how to play</i>.
</p>
<p>
    Gamblers were rewarded for memorizng the 281 Basic Strategy decisions (<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2021/12/05/Learn-Blackjack-in-your-Sleep/">which you can now learn in your sleep!</a>).
    If someone wanted to be lazy and accept poor odds, they could just play Roulette. If
    someone wanted better odds but had a lot of money, they could play Baccarat. But now low limit
    players have really nowhere to turn for an option with a low house edge.
</p>
<p>
    But worst of all, casinos are just giving you a shitty experience and not giving you anything in return.
</p>
<p>
    I hate using the term "Slippery Slope", but it's more than appropriate here. This isn't a hypothetical
    slope that is coming down the road in 5 to 10 years. This is already happening. It's a garbage chute
    greased with hot butter and we're all being actively shoved down it.
</p>
<p>
    Every time consumers accept crap like this, corporations come back with more ways to screw us. We're
    already seeing this with ridiculous changes like <b>Triple-Zero Roulette</b> (7.69% house
    edge), casino parking fees, and don't even get me started on <b>Resort Fees</b>
    when booking a hotel. 
</p>
<p>
    So don't play 6-to-5 Blackjack.<br/>
    Don't let your friends play 6-to-5 Blackjack.<br/>
    Mock people playing 6-to-5 Blackjack.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    If you can help stop this insanity, maybe together we can prevent the birth of
    <b>"Quadruple Zero Roulette"</b>, <b>"Ties-Count-as-a-Loss Baccarat"</b>, and
    <b>"11-to-10 Blackjack"</b>.
