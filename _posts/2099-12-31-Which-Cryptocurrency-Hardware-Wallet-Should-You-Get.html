        If you have more than $10k in crypto, you should have a hardware wallet...or two.

<p>
    If all of your crypto is on an exchange, do you really own it?
</p>

<p>
    If that exchange gets shut down or if an employee decides to walk away with
    the company's coffer, how would you get your money back?
</p>
<p>
    The short answer is <i>you won't</i>.
</p>
<p>
    There is little to no protection for a crypto investor with their assets in a crypto
    exchange. The FDIC won't protect you from large losses if the exchange goes under or if
    they just decide they don't like you and they don't want to honor your deposit.
</p>
<p>
    If you have more than $10,000 worth of crypto, a small $150 investment in a hardware
    wallet can prevent such a disaster and can offer you peace of mind.
</p>

<h2>Who is Running Your Crypto Exchange?</h2>
<p>
    If you want to hire the best accountant, you have over a <b>MILLION</b> to choose from in the US
    and you can pick and choose very specifically what type of accountant you want.
</p>
<p>
    If you want to hire the best real estate attorney, you have thousands to choose from in the US.
    The most experienced ones will have <b>DECADES</b> of experience and may even be part of a family
    of real estate lawyers going back several generations.
</p>
<p>
    And both of these professions have well established certification processes to ensure they know
    what they are doing. You can make sure your accountant is a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and
    you can make sure your attorney is a memeber of the state bar association.
</p>
<p>
    There really is no recognized certification process for cryptocurrencies. And even the
    <i>"experts"</i> would only have a few years' worth of experience working with it.
</p>

<blockquote>
    Crypto is a new industry.<br/>
    No COO has more than a few years of experience with it.<br/>
    No Security "expert" has more than a few years of experience protecting it.<br/>
    No Attorney has more than a few years of experience with it.<br/>
    There are no certifications for proving someone is an expert in the field.<br/>
    And the fact that it is <i>purely</i> digital makes it extremely easy to steal.<br/>
</blockquote>

<p>
    At one point in 2013 the man in charge of the largest crypto company was a 29 year-old man
    named Ross "Dread Pirate Roberts" Ulbrecht of the site <i>Silk Road</i>. He was worth over $80
    million and oversaw over $1 BILLION in transactions through his site. He got caught after
    bragging LinkedIn about how he ran a multi-million dollar drug marketplace.
</p>
<p>
    This is an example of the geniuses that have been founding crypto companies.

<h2>Why Get a Cryptocurrency Wallet?</h2>
<p>
    The main reasons for controlling your crypto are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Many Custodial Crypto Companies notoriously have shitty security.
    </li>
    <li>
        Many Custodial Crypto Companies don't fully understand the law.
    </li>
    <li>
        Many Custodial Crypto Companies don't fully understand proper operational procedure.
    </li>
    <li>
        Authorities may decide you don't have a right to your money.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>The History of Entrusting Crypto to Others</h2>
<p>
    The history of custodial management in crypto has been a mess.

<p>
    We're still in the early days of crypto. The term "Wild Wild West" is an extremely appropriate 
    description of the current crypto era.
</p>
<p>
    For <i>ANY</i> cyrpto company that might hold your coins, you are going to be subject
    to four major risks.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Lack of legal expertise
    </li>
    <li>
        Lack of operational expertise
    </li>
    <li>
        Shitty security practices
    </li>
    <li>
        Intentional fraud (Ponzi schemes, Rug pulls, etc.)
    </li>
    <li>
        Freezing your account for legal reasons
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If a businessman today decides he wants to build a company that centers around crypto, he is
    almost certainly a <i>severe</i> risk-taker. This is an <i>EXTREMELY</i> fast-moving sector
    where things like folliwng laws and ensuring security often fall by the wayside.
</p>
<p>
    It's difficult to find anyone with more than a few months of experience with laws and security
    in the cyrpto space, so making sure your corportation is protected from both a legal and
    cybersecurity standpoint is extremely difficult.
</p>
<p>
    And technology companies are expected to deliver new features at a breakneck rate.
</p>
<p>
    This means that any crypto company that you might entrust with your coins is going to be subject to

</p>

<h2>What is a Hardware Wallet?</h2>
<p>
    When you hear the term "wallet", you usually think of an object that holds valuables inside.
    It's true that a hardware wallet protects valuables, but it's not the cryptocurrencies themselves.
    A crypto wallet doesn't hold crypto. The valuable thing you're holding is the "keys".
</p>
<p>
    I'll say it again:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <b>A crypto wallet doesn't hold crypto.</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
    A cryptocurrency hardware wallet is just a device that manages your access (private keys) to
    coins you have stored in the global blockchain. When you want to move coins from one address
    to another, the hardware wallet requests the transaction and stamps it with a signature that
    only it know how to create.
</p>

        Trezor and Ledger are the two biggest players in the Hardware Wallet space.

<p>
    There are two major cryptocurrency hardware wallet maufacturers: Trezor and Ledger. If you buy either of
    their top two products, you'll be fine. The biggest difference between the two is that the Ledger can handle
    more coins.

    I really don't think you can go wrong with any of the above choices. Your biggest concerns should
    be cost and support for your desired coins. I think the Trezor is easier to use, but it is more
    expensive. I also like that Trezor has different color wallets. This is helpful if you have multiple
    wallets (which I <i>strongly</i> suggest you get).
</p>
<p>
    Also, Ledger had an issue with their customer data being stolen and used in numerous phishing attacks.
    I was a victim of these attacks. It's not good knowing that not just your email address, but your
    home address is floating around hacker databases and being sold to bad actors.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    I understood the value a decentralized currency when I realized that it is basically Venmo without an
    overlord who can subjectively and sometimes arbitrarily deny your transactions.
</p>
<p>
    I've had money taken away from me by PayPal because an eBay customer fraudulently lied to them about a
    transaction we made together.
</p>
<p>
    I know people who have had their Venmo accounts locked because the transaction comments mentioned the
    word "poker".
</p>
<p>
    I've had my NETELLER account frozen because I moved to a different country and they thought I was trying
    to commit fraud.
</p>
<p>
    If you entrust a large part of your life savings to a company that isn't safeguarded by established
    practices and regulatory protections, you shouldn't be surprised if you lose access to it all.
