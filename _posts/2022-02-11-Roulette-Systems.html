    On our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/gambling/roulette/systems/">Roulette System page</a>, find a system
    that suits your buy-in budget and betting size. If the stats and ratings look good, click the system
    name to see more details for that system.

<h2>System Details</h2>

        How did this system do? Check the spin-by-spin results on the details page!
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    On the system's page, you can see more of the details, including info on the betting scheme
    and whether there are different betting tiers when the system requires
    {% include glossary-term.html term="Martingale" displayName="Martingaling" %}
    after a loss.
</p>
<p>
    If you think the system will work for you, there's a link to CEG Dealer School's YouTube video
    so you can watch the system in action.
</p>

<h2>The Betting Scheme</h2>
<figure>

    <figcaption>
        If there are multiple betting tiers or schemes, they will be displayed here.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    You can see how the bets are laid out and how much you stand to win or lose with every spin. If 
    the system has multiple tiers, you can click on the tier amount to see how the betting and
    payouts change.
</p>
<p>
    We used JackAce's
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/gambling/roulette/bet-analyzer/">Roulette Bet Analyzer</a> to generate
    these betting scheme images. Read more about this tool on our
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2022/01/21/Roulette-Bet-Analyzer/">blog post</a>.

<h2>Spin-by-Spin Results</h2>

<p>
    See the spin-by-spin results below the details. You can track the rise and fall of the
    system by looking at the Running Total column. If there multiple "friends" playing this
    system, then their results are broken out and grouped together.
</p>

<h2>Spin Distribution</h2>

    <figcaption>
        You can even see how often each number has hit. Over time, these values should approach
        the expected percentage of 2.63%
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    How do your favorite numbers perform? See how often each number has hit and whether it's
    far out of whack with the other numbers. It's all available on our
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/gambling/roulette/systems/distribution/">spin distribution page</a>.

<h2>Want to Contribute?</h2>
<p>
    We've just started our efforts to catalog the extensive list of CEG Roulette Systems. We're able
    to keep up with new systems, but we could use some help backfilling the dozens of older reviews.
</p>
<p>
    Even if you're not a programmer or web designer, you can help maintain this list!
    It's a lot easier than you think. There's just a single <code>.json</code> file that you need
    to edit. All you need is a GitHub account.
</p>
