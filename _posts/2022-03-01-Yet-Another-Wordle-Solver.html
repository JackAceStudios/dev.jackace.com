    If you've been seeing a bunch of green and yellow squares in your social media feed, then your friends are
    probably addicted to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/" target="_blank">WORDLE</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Wordle, the game that hit the internet by storm in late 2021, has been a hit amongst gamers and gamblers alike.
    It has been a source of joy as well as extreme anguish for those who choose to play.
</p>
<p>
    On one of my first attempts, I got stuck and ended up busting out pen and paper to go through all of the
    possibilities...only to discover that they allow double letters!
</p>
<p>
    Well, as a software engineer, I firmly believe that "Anything worth doing is also worth automating."
</p>
<p>
    So I wrote (yet another) Wordle solver!
</p>

<h2>Wordle Solver v1: Pure JavaScript</h2>
<p>
    I originally wrote a solver in pure JavaScript. It is currently
    <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/JackAce/kd30gjec/" target="_blank">hosted on JSFiddle</a>
    and you can see it for yourself on your desktop or laptop computer.
</p>
<p>
    The reason why it's not available on mobile is because the official solution list and accepted word list
    is so large, loading it into memory in your browser crashes most mobile devices.
</p>
<p>
    I could only take this version so far because it was so memory intensive, especially with all the
    added scaffolding needed by JSFiddle.
</p>
<p>
    It works, but it's not great because I had to basically just merge the official solution list with the
    official allowed guess list, so it's difficult to weed out words that we know won't be correct.
</p>

<h2>Wordle Solver v2a: Node.js</h2>
<p>
    In order to take the solver to the next level, I had to move the solution to a hosted service that can
    just accept a user's request, perform the filtering and ranking, and then just spit out the results to
    the user's browser.
</p>
<p>
    So I wrote a simple service in Node.js and hosted it on Heroku.
