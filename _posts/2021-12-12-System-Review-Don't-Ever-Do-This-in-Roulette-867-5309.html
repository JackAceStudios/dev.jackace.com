<br/>
<p>
    The good folks at <a href="https://cegdealers.com/">CEG Dealer School</a> tested 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g46h_Lv9_UU">this Roulette system</a> named after
    the famous Tommy Tutone song 'Jenny (867-5309)', which topped the charts back in 1981.
    I thought I'd cover this system because it has a characteristic many people probably
    recognize, and I was surprised CEG didn't discuss it in much detail.
</p>

<h2>The System</h2>

<p>
    This is a simple flat-betting system. There is no doubling/Martingale component. You bet on Jenny's phone
    number as well as two dozens, and (for some unknown reason) <b>all three columns</b>.
</p>
<p>
    I've modified the system to remove the three column bets for reasons that I cover later on.

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>
    Like every Roulette system, you're going to lose 5.26% of all money wagered. But there's a <b>BIG</b> flaw with 
    this system. The problem is that the three column bets by themselves result in you covering 36 different numbers.
</p>
<p>
    If you find yourself simultaneously betting 36 different numbers, then <b>YOU ARE WASTING MONEY</b>! You've created
    a situation where you have bets that cancel each other out <i>ENTIRELY</i> with no hope of increasing your wins.
</p>
<p>
    This means that there is
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2022/01/22/Bet-Nullification-in-Roulette/">"nullification"</a>
    in your bets. When this happens, then it's possible to rearrange some of 
    your bets and reduce your total amount bet with <b>ZERO</b> affect to your winnings, and you save money when
    the two uncovered numbers hit.
</p>
<p>
    This nullification is extremely easy to see. Just look at these three column bets and ignore the rest. Whenever you
    hit
    {% include roulette-spot.html number="1" %}
    through
    {% include roulette-spot.html number="36" -%}, you will
    lose two of the column bets, but the winning column bet wins two units, resulting in a net gain of $0. But if
    you spin a
    {% include roulette-spot.html number="0" %}
    or
    {% include roulette-spot.html number="00" -%},
    you will lose 
    all three bets! This means that taken together, there is a \(36 \over 38\) chance that you win <i>nothing</i>, and a
    \(2 \over 38\) chance that you <b>LOSE ALL THREE BETS</b>!
</p>
<p>
    This nullification exists no matter how you cover the 36 numbers. It can be as simple as simultaneously betting both
    Red AND Black, or it could be a combination of inside and outside bets. It isn't always easy to remove the 
    nullification when you bet the inside and outside, but know that the nullification exists and that you're reducing your
    EV with no potential for reward!
</p>
<p>
    I have eliminated these three bets in my modified system, and as you can see below, all payouts are the same with the
    exception of
    {% include roulette-spot.html number="0" %}
    and
    {% include roulette-spot.html number="00" -%},
    which save you $15 when they hit.

    Overall, this system has 7 good numbers, 7 bad numbers, and 24 near neutral numbers. The 7 whacks are going to kill
    you a huge amount of the time. On average, you'll get whacked every 5 to 6 spins.
</p>
<p>
    Since you're betting $235 per spin (after removing the column bets), you're going to lose about $12.36 per spin in the
    long run.
</p>


<h2>Live Results</h2>

    Here are the actual spin-by-spin results as seen on the YouTube video. They didn't happen to hit any
    Zeroes, so there's no delta between the original system any my <i>improved</i> system.

<h2>Jack's Rating</h2>

<p>
    You often hear that every betting system is as worthless as the next, and this is mostly true in Roulette.
    You can't escape the 5.26% house edge, but it can be fun to sing the classic song as you're putting chips on the felt.
</p>
<p>
    But this system is actually <i>more</i> worthless than others because of the
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2022/01/22/Bet-Nullification-in-Roulette/">"nullified" bets</a>.
    For that reason, I'm giving it the dreaded Durian (F).
</p>
<p>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/systems/ceg-grading-scale-f-durian.png" alt="Durian" height="200" />
</p>
<p>
    Even without the column bets, I'd probably give it a Plum (C) or Eggplant (D). Betting the bottom two dozens as 
    well as the 7 digits from the phone number is just too much money spread out in hopes of a small win.
</p>



<h2>The classic song!</h2>

    If you're not familiar with the classic hit, take a trip to 1981 by and enjoy this video:
